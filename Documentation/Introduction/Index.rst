What does it do?
================
The TYPO3 Layer Slider extension connects the TYPO3 backend with the Layer Slider. Creating new slides thus becomes child's play. For each slide there are a lot of options available to the slide to make it unique.

For each slide also new layers (pro version only) can be created with text or images. On the "Positioning Stage", the individual layers are placed on the slider and with the mouse you can dragthe item to the desired position.

The background images for the slides as well as for the individual layers (Cut, smaller images, etc.) can easily select and uploaded within the TYPO3 Filebrowser.

The "Transition Gallery" (pro version only) offers a variety of transitions, whether 2D or 3D. Thus, the transitions can be designed by a slide to the next even more impressive.

The TYPO3 Layer Slider extension based on the Layer Slider by kreatura media offers a high level of comfort for those who do not want to turn the slider with HTML. To maintain the slider there is a own backend mmodule. To use a Layer Slider on one side only the Layer Slider Plugin has to be placed. In a selection box can be selected from all sliders.

In this free version you have this features:

- Create/edit sliders as many you want
- Create/edit slides as many you want
- make all slider/slide options as in the full version

With the full version you get this features:
- Create/edit layers for slides as many you need
- Use the transition gallery for real cool effects!
